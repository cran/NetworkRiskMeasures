\title{Computes the (binary) impact or vulnerability matrices}
\usage{
risk_matrix(
  exposures,
  buffer,
  binary = FALSE,
  exposure_type = c("assets", "liabilities", "impact", "vulnerability"),
  returns = c("impact", "vulnerability")
)

vulnerability_matrix(
  exposures,
  buffer,
  binary = FALSE,
  exposure_type = c("assets", "liabilities", "impact", "vulnerability")

)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposures}{an adjacency \code{\link{matrix}}, (sparse) \code{\link{Matrix}} or an \code{\link[igraph]{igraph}}
object with the network of bilateral exposures between vertices. By default, the function
expects the exposures in the form of an assets matrix
in which A -> B means that A has an asset with B. However, you can
change that with the parameter \code{exposure_type}. When using a matrix, preferably it should have
rows and columns names.}

\item{buffer}{a numeric vector with the capital buffer for each vertex.
Values should be in the same row/column order as the network of bilateral exposures. The
buffer is not needed if \code{exposure_type = "vulnerability"}.}

\item{binary}{if \code{binary = TRUE} the function computes a 'binary' impact or vulnerability matrix.
It truncates all values less than 1 to 0 and all values greater than 1 to 1.}

\item{exposure_type}{character vector indicating the type of the bilateral exposures. It can be
an \code{"assets"} network (where A -> B means that A has an asset with B),
a \code{"liabilities"} network (where A -> B means that A has a debt with B),
a (binary) \code{"impact"} matrix (where A -> B indicates the relative impact
 of A in B's capital buffer), or 
a (binary) \code{"vulnerability"} matrix 
(where A -> B indicates the relative impact A suffers from B's default). 
The default is \code{"assets"}.}

\item{returns}{will the function return the impact or the vulnerability matrix?
The default is \code{"impact"}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a (binary) impact or vulnerability matrix.

The term V[i,j] of the impact matrix represents
the impact of i's default in j's capital buffer. 

The term V[i,j] of the vulnerability matrix represents
how much i's capital buffer is impacted by j's default. 

If \code{binary = TRUE}
the values less than 1 are truncated to zero.
}
\description{
The function computes an impact or vulnerability matrix given
a network of bilateral exposures and a vector of capital buffers.
}
\details{
The impact matrix represents how much a vertex impacts the capital buffer of another vertex
when it defaults.

 The vulnerability matrix  is just the transpose of the impact matrix. It represents how much a vertex is impacted 
 by the default of another vertex.

# Creating example data
## Assets Matrix (bilateral exposures)
assets_matrix <- matrix(c(0, 10, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0), ncol = 3)
rownames(assets_matrix) <- colnames(assets_matrix) <- letters[1:3]

## Capital Buffer
buffer <- c(a = 2, b = 5, c = 2)

# Vulnerability matrices
vulnerability_matrix(assets_matrix, buffer, binary = FALSE)
vulnerability_matrix(assets_matrix, buffer, binary = TRUE)
